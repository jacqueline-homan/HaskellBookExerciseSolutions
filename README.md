# HaskellBookExerciseSolutions

This is an unofficial set of the Haskell book exercise solutions (minus the ones done strictly in the GHCi shell)

There are also some added example code snippets and programs
that are not part of the Haskell book which may be helpful
(such as that in the SimplePatterns.hs file).
